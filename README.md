# LegoManager
 LegoManager is a CRUD application used to track the number of lego sets in a collection as well as important details about those sets.
 
 ## Description
 This is my first CRUD application. It pulls together some basic concepts and C# language fundamentals I was learning at the time including classes and objects, methods, formatting output, input validation. Users can view, add, edit, and delete sets from their collection.
